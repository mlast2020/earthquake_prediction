This folder includes the following four Jupyter notebooks:
1. israel_import-Copy1.ipynb - imports the data and runs the foreshock aftershock classification algorithm.  
2. israel_create_time_series_features from mainshocks-Copy1.ipynb - creates features on the mainshocks only. 
3. israel_create_features from all shocks-Copy1.ipynb - creates features using all shocks. 
4. israel_results-Copy1.ipynb - runs all machine learning algorithms.

All code is demonstrated on Israeli data.  Sample data files from Israel, California, and Japan are stored in the data.zip archive.
